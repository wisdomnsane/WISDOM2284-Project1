            The luxury car industry is booming and is ready to continue providing wealthy 
            customers with the latest prestigious models of sports and luxury cars. As expected, 
            the average price for a new vehicle has risen over the last few years, which is especially
             noticeable at the premium end of the market. To see what the industry has to offer at the 
             top-tier level, we take a look at some of the world’s most expensive cars currently on the market.
             After two fairly odd years for car manufacturers, 2023 looks incredibly encouraging, having been marked
             by several recent releases and innovative new technology. Manual transmissions are returning to hypercars,
             while companies like Pagani and Koenigsegg have introduced advanced manuals to improve the driving experience.
             Moreover, several special editions powered by gasoline engines have been issued, which has been widely regarded
             as the last hurrah for the internal combustion era before EV and battery-powered models take over.
             We cover the most expensive cars in each category, scrutinizing new models, classic cars, EVs, and the most 
             exclusive models available from high-luxury brands.

            The Lamborghini Urus set the bar high when it was revealed in 2018. Now, it is seeking to
             reclaim its position as the world’s most dynamic SUV, with the new edition appropriately named
              Performante. While the power has only been raised slightly to 657 hp, everything else has been 
              considerably upgraded and modified. The result is a lightning-fast SUV which can go from 0 to 60 mph
               in just 3.3 seconds, along with sharper handling, braking, and driving dynamics. The design has
                different trim, color, and wheel choices, and is more lightweight.

                    The brand-new Range Rover might look like the outgoing model but is, in fact, an all-new car based
                     on a new platform, with elegant body panels and an incredibly luxurious interior. The company knows 
                     just how important this nameplate is and has done its best to present a shape that is recognizable and 
                     modern at the same time. For the most discerning buyers, JLR has presented the Range Rover SV Carmel Edition,
                      which is the ultimate luxury SUV. The power comes from a twin-turbo V8 with 523 hp, which gives 
                      this Range Rover a very confident performance. But what really gives this model the edge is the 
                      long-wheel-base chassis, exclusive four-seat arrangement,finest materials, unique color choices, 
                      and trim pieces, all of which justify the asking price.

                    There are many Porsche 911-based restomods overcrowding the supercar market. However, of 
                    all the new car manufacturers, there is one name that has been in the business of making fast 
                    Porsches even faster since 1975. RUF is known for its unique approach, technical expertise, and 
                    exclusivity, which is why its latest creation has stirred up so much interest. The RUF Bergmeister 
                    has just been revealed as its lightest and most agile creation yet. Based on the 993 generation of 
                    Porsche 911, the Bergmeister has a unique roadster design, body panels, and engine upgraded to 450 hp.
                     Even though it doesn’t sound like much, it’s worth bearing in mind that the overall 
                    weight is under 2,425 pounds, making the Bergmeister extraordinarily dynamic and fun to drive

                    One of the sports car legends that history has neglected is DeTomaso, an Italian company that produced some of 
                    the most exciting cars of the 70s. Recently revived by a Hong Kong investment group, DeTomaso is set to claim 
                    its position on the market with a magnificent P72, which combines supercharged V8 power with an Italian 
                    retro-futuristic design. The P72 has a carbon monocoque chassis and lots of trick racing technology, 
                    and its 5.0-liter V8 delivers over 700 hp. Interestingly, the only transmission option is a 6-speed manual,
                     which makes the car closely aligned with its roots. Only 72 will be built, and this unique creation is on sale now.
